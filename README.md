Tooling &amp; Solutions for Advent of Code 2022 problems

## CLI
I am working on a CLI for local development while working on these solutions.

CLI currently supports scaffolding of a new solution folder structure with base solution file.

You can run it by running the following command in the root directory

```crystal cli/cli.cr new -f <folder_name>```
